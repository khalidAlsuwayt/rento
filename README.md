# Rento

Rento is a website where you can offer and rent Items from one account, no need to have two accounts.

for live demo you can click on this link: http://rento123.infinityfreeapp.com/rento/

for the database you can download the sql file and import it to your DBMS.

I have used reCaptcha v2 to validate users when registering then send them an email through gmail SMTP to activate their account, to send emails
just put your email and password in sendEmail.php .

I have used MapBox for Maps.

This Project is almost completed, it is still missing few features and need some improvments for some security issues.
